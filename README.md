# Tête
Tête - a non-interactive consensus mechanism is similar to the Satoshi Nakamoto protocol. 

The implementation principle comes from the paper ”How to Mimic Nakamoto’s Design via Proof-of-Stake“.

## Tête's inspiration
1. Tête is a French word, which means brain. 
2. The inspiration for adopting it here origin from similar between 'tê' and 'te'. On the one hand, it means the longest chain competition mechanism as the Satoshi Nakamoto protocol. On the other hand, it implies a mimic with similarity, but there are some differences, such as between Proof-of-Work with scalable Proof-of-Stake.
